The way you play the game snake is to move the green dot using the arrow keys on your
keyboard. While moving the green dot, try to have it collide with the yellow and the blue
dot, both worth ten and twenty points respectively. As you collect the blue or yelow dots,
your green dot will increment by one red circle at a time representing the body of the
snake. If you let the green dot touch either the red circles or collide with the 
boundaries, the game will restart with the red dots removed and the score set to zero
while the high score will remain unchanged unless the player's next score surpasses it.
